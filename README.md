## 🚀 Overview

**Tayronuk PassGen** is a desktop application designed to improve personal security. Unlike web-based generators that might store your data, this tool runs **locally** on your machine, ensuring your passwords are generated safely and privately. It features a "Strength Meter" to visualize password complexity.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🖥️ User-Friendly GUI:** Clean interface built with `tkinter`.
* **🎛️ Customizable:** Adjust length (8-32 chars) and toggle Uppercase/Numbers/Symbols.
* **💪 Strength Meter:** Visual feedback on how strong your password is (Weak/Strong/Unbreakable).
* **📋 One-Click Copy:** Instantly copy the result to your clipboard.
* **🔒 100% Offline:** No internet connection required, zero data logging.
